PROJECT INFORMATION

My personal CV has the following sections:

1. About me: A short description of myself where I talk about what I am studying currently and my hobbies so the company learns about
how I am.

2. Work experience: Companies want to know if I have worked previously in the same sector, so this section cointains the information about my experience in the video game industry.

3. Education: Contains information of what studies I have completed, at what institution and when.

4. Skills. To get a job, I have to promote myself, including some skills, such as punctuality and teamwork.

5. Languages: It is very important to include what languages I am able to use. In the video game industry, English is very necessary because many studios have people from other countries.

6. More information: Additional information that does not belong to any of the past categories. For example, the driving license

7. Contact: My e-mail and mobile phone so the company can write or call me if they are interested.

VISUAL DESIGN

My CV has a heading with my name, and the information is splitted into two parts. The left part contains my personal information (my description, hobbies and extras), and the right part contains the most important information for the company, such as the work experience (they always want people with previous experience at the same sector), the skills and the languages I know.

I have decided to use this placement because it is the same I have in my personal CV. Personally, I find it easier and more pleasant to divide the information in two different sections rather than having it sequentially, one below the other.

I have also used italic and bold fonts. The italic ones are on the skills and languages lists, and the bold fonts are used to highlight the most important info (studies, languages, etc).
